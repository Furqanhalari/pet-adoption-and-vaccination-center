**Project Title**
Pet Adoption and Vaccination Center

**Project Description**
Developed a comprehensive Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) based Pet Adoption Management System using C++. This project involves a detailed and organized approach to manage the various aspects of a pet adoption center, including adopters, pets, volunteers, donations, and vaccination records.

**Key Features and Components**
1.**Data Management**: Handled various data files such as adopters, adoption records, analytics, donations, pets, users, vaccinations, and volunteers.
2.**Class Structure**: Designed and implemented multiple classes and their interactions:
3.**adopter.h** and **adopter.cpp**: Manages adopter information.
4.**adopterCenter.h** and **adopterCenter.cpp**: Central class for managing the adoption process.
5.**adoptionRecordManager.h** and **adoptionRecordManager.cpp**: Manages records of adoptions.
6.**costManager.h** and **costManager.cpp**: Tracks costs associated with pet care and adoption.
7.**donationManager.h** and **donationManager.cpp**: Manages donations and donor information.
8.**fileManager.h** and **fileManager.cpp**: Handles file I/O operations.
9.**menu.h** and **menu.cpp**: User interface for navigating the system.
10.**pet.h** and **pet.cpp**: Manages pet information.
11.**termsAndConditions.h** and **termsAndConditions.cpp**: Manages terms and conditions for adopters.
12.**userManager.h** and **userManager.cpp**: Manages user data and authentication.
13.**vaccination.h** and **vaccination.cpp**: Tracks pet vaccinations.
14.**volunteerManager.h** and **volunteerManager.cpp**: Manages volunteer information.
